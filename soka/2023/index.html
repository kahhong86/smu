      The College of Integrative Studies and the Wee Kim Wee Centre are proud
      to present the <strong>7th Annual Wee Kim Wee Soka International Seminar on
      Global Peace and Understanding</strong> on 16 February 2023. The Soka
      International Seminar is an annual event focused on the Big Questions
      explored by Singapore Management University’s Core Curriculum, with the
      aim of advancing the frontiers of our queries through engagements with the
		public.</p><p> This year, the theme is Wealth and Poverty. Through critical
      engagement crossing multiple disciplinary boundaries, the Soka
      International Seminar 2023 examines new ways of thinking about the
      pursuits, pathways, and praxis of wealth and poverty in our contemporary
      world. Bringing together academics, policymakers, activists, artists and
      practitioners from different disciplines, the seminar aims to be a platform for
      open and constructive dialogue among key stakeholders and specialists to
      foster deeper understanding of how these two phenomena intersect and
      converge in ways that influence our everyday lives. </p>

                  The number of people forced to flee conflict, violence, human rights violations and persecution is now at the staggering milestone of 100 million, with the recent crisis in Ukraine joining a long list of terrible situations forcing people to flee. Many challenges face displaced individuals and families. These include navigating the complexities of new environments and experiencing difficulties accessing medical and educational services, safe shelter and livelihood opportunities.  All sectors of society are doing their part to help. Humanitarian agencies like UNHCR are there to provide immediate lifesaving assistance like shelter, food and water, and also  longer term solutions like access to education, healthcare, clean energy, livelihood opportunities , amongst others. Without sufficient funding however, the work of humanitarian organizations is limited. This talk will focus on the global displacement crisis as well as resource mobilization efforts in Singapore.

                    Green finance has seen strong interest among policy makers and investors across developed and developing countries over the past 5 years. Yet, as a share of the total market, green finance remains small. To advance sustainable development across the Asia Pacific region, scaling green finance is paramount. The presentation will highlight the major bottlenecks and share lessons from other emerging and developed economies based on the Climate Finance report for the G20 in Indonesia, which was written by Prof. Nedopil.

                  Climate change is causing sea-level rise, intense and frequent storm surge flooding, and significant shoreline erosion in Malaysian coastal areas. Coastal areas are already facing various risks due to increasing climate-related hazards that are likely to amplify with changing climate and make the households living in these areas even more vulnerable in terms of livelihoods and living conditions. Households living in the close vicinity of shoreline are constantly threatened by various climate change impacts. Community awareness towards climate change is a subject of considerable study as adequate knowledge is a preliminary step for adaptation decision making. An important question is how coastal communities perceive climatic variation, sea level rise and coastal hazard impacts and the socio-economic factors that affect their level of awareness. Households in coastal need capacity building and climate change awareness initiatives which would assist household to build adaptive capacity, increase resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change.

While substantial progress is made to the position of women in the Singaporean society, any worthwhile attempt at understanding 'gender equality' calls for analysing beyond the binary categorisation of male and female. When gender inequality and financial instability intersect, it creates unique barriers faced only by women. Having assisted women from lower-income communities, Ms Fannie Lim, Executive Director of Daughters Of Tomorrow, will highlight the often-silent struggles endured during their day-to-day life and show why poverty needs to be analysed through a gender lens. As the world, including Singapore, recovers from Covid-19 pandemic, understanding the barriers faced at the intersection of women’s issues and poverty is timely.

Digitalization not only brings opportunities but also faces new issues and uncertainties (e.g., environment impact). It is demanding regarding governance, which helps to ensure sustainability and inclusivity. How to ensure digitalization itself is environment-friendly? How could digitalization contribute to sustainable development? What is the role of law here? This paper explores these issues from the perspective of central bank digital currency, the digital version of fiat currency (e.g., the possible digital dollar), which would profoundly affect the society in the digital age.

                    A new prosperity gospel is emerging in the Philippines. We call it the prosperity ethic. Its dimensions set it apart from the previous incarnation of the prosperity gospel, which emphasized tithing and confessing. The prosperity ethic values upward mobility and uses biblical principles for the acquisition of practical skills to become rich. We make our case by drawing on the writings of two of the most influential prosperity-oriented preachers in the country. Three dimensions are evident: the morality of wealth (believing right), the prescribed mindset (thinking right), and the practical skills to accumulate wealth (doing it right). The rise of the prosperity ethic is related to major shifts in the economy since the 1990s. For sanctifying individual hard work and desire, the new prosperity gospel is emblematic of neoliberal Christianity in the Philippines today.

                       In our world of abundant resources, poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation continue to be among the most intractable problems today. As the world continues relentlessly to pursue its growth and development agendas, will these conditions worsen? Or will there be renewed prospects for remaking our world to bring about greater democracy, justice, and creativity without compromising prosperity and security? Kenneth Paul Tan discusses the role that popular movies can play in generating awareness, critical thinking, and transformative action with regard to climate justice.

                       In 1968, the former-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew once remarked that “poetry is a luxury we cannot afford” (Koh, 2021). While many such as Koh Tai Ann have looked at the value of Singapore literature (affectionately called Sing Lit) within the parameters of a literary education, this presentation focuses on the wider social arena, and provides a survey of how various stakeholders in the Sing Lit scene such as Sing Lit Station, Poetry Festival Singapore, the Migrant Writers of Singapore and the various Spoken Word event organisers have employed creative writing (mostly poetry) as an enabling and democratising force for greater participation in the larger national conversation.

                      What and why do we crave for more? For More money? More fame? More materials? Based on his personal interpretation of the concept, The Theory of More, Imran will share about how it has inspired him to create artistic expressions to nurture the value of inclusivity through Maya Dance Theatre – Diverse Abilities Dance Collective (DADC) . The Theory of More juxtaposes and also propels the act of “giving back” to society, creating a community, addressing inclusivity and wellness and these values stand as tenets of Imran’s creative producing works for the company.

                    Meritocracy is a cornerstone of Singapore’s success. However, as society progresses, there is risk of privilege being entrenched across generations, affecting social equality and mobility. How can we build a more open and compassionate meritocracy in Singapore, where every Singaporean has the opportunity to thrive, grow and realise their aspirations, regardless of their starting point in life? In this address, Dr Janil Puthucheary will share more about the aspirations for meritocracy under Forward SG. He also looks forward to a conversation with young Singaporeans on shaping a better, more equitable future for Singapore.

       Mr Ang Kian Peng, Founder of Samsui Kitchen , Founder/ Advisor for The Social Kitchen. Both social enterprises focus on helping people from the vulnerable community to become self sufficient by providing meaningful jobs to them. Samsui Kitchen is manned by underprivileged people who prepare food for nursing homes, effectively incorporating the ‘available’ manpower from the underprivileged group to give back to another sector of society. As the director of Samsui Supplies & Services, Ang Kian Peng, says, “We realised the food served at nursing homes was limited, so we decided to use our F&amp;B skills and professional chefs to provide them with quality and reasonably priced food. Why not turn our CSR into a long-term solution for them?”
